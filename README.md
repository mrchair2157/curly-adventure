This will be a calculator written in C for fun, I will try to make it an option compared to other calculators. although i do not have any immediate plans to make a gui.
IMPORTANT: the code will be buged until it is a working relaese the point is to show progress.
if there are any ways to make my code more effectent please tell me.
i also need a way to get a bunch of numbers for a mean median and mode, I think command line arguments and reading them in from a text file.
