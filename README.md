This will be a calculator written in C for fun, I will try to make it an option compared to other calculators. although i do not have any immediate plans to make a gui.
if there are any ways to make my code more effectent please tell me.
i also need a way to get a bunch of numbers for a mean median and mode, I think command line arguments and reading them in from a text file.
main is developoment and the releases branch are(should be stable) stable working release

I have moved on from this and will be archiving it. It is filled with what i think is bad code.
